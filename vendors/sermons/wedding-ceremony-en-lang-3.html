                                        only to them, each other.</span>

                                        Bridegroom. May our hearts beat in love for Him. May our minds be
                                        upon Him, and waiting and longing for that great Wedding Supper
                                        that’s going to be in the air, one day when He does come. Though
                                        He tarry, yet He’ll be here. And as we leave today, then may this be
                                        reunited in our minds and our hearts, and may we pledge ourself to
